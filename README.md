# Hi ðŸ‘‹!
<p align="justify"> My name is John Ivan Puayap, and I am a computer science student with a passion for backend development. I am currently pursuing my degree   while actively working on personal projects and pursuing certifications to expand my knowledge and skills in this field. As part of my continuous learning journey, I have taken up the #100DaysofCode Challenge to further enhance my expertise.

In addition to programming, I have diverse interests outside the tech world. I enjoy watching TV shows, particularly comedy genres that bring laughter and  entertainment. I also find joy in playing video games, immersing myself in different virtual worlds and experiencing exciting adventures. These hobbies provide me with relaxation and serve as a source of inspiration and creativity in my coding endeavors. Ultimately, my goal is to become a proficient backend developer and leverage my skills to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology. </p>

# Personal Projects
<h3><a href="https://github.com/johnivanpuayap/100-days-of-code">100 Days of Code</a></h3>
<p align="justify"> The "100-Days-of-Code" repository chronicles my personal journey to enhance my coding skills over a period of 100 days, starting from June 5, 2023<!--, and concluding on September 12, 2023-->. Inspired by Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCodeChallenge, this endeavor involves dedicating a minimum of 3 to 4 hours each day to coding activities. For more information about the challenge, you can visit here.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/johnivanpuayap/CrazyCalculator">Crazy Calculator</h3>
<p align="justify"> The Crazy Calculator which is built on Java is a unique implementation of a calculator. The mathematical operations are processed using stacks that are implemented using queues. Queues, in turn, are implemented using arrays that are implemented using linked lists. </p>

<!-- <h3>Genshin Artifact Adder</h3>
<p align="justify"> The Genshin Artifact Adder is a web-based tool built using the MERN stack. This tool enables users to upload artifacts from the popular game, Genshin Impact, and automatically calculates their stats, while ensuring that only valid artifacts are added. The tool features a sleek and intuitive user interface built using React.js, which allows users to easily upload artifacts and view their stats. The backend of the tool is built using Node.js and Express.js, which enables efficient processing of the data and ensures the tool runs smoothly. The Genshin Artifact Adder utilizes MongoDB to store the uploaded artifact data, which allows for easy retrieval and management of the data.</p> -->
